# About Me üòÅ
## Introduction üëã
I am a native of Jackson, MS (JXNMS), an Ole Miss alum, and have two four-legged best friends: Wesley (Snipes) and Bruce-Lee. During my downtime, I enjoy games nights, working on jigsaw puzzles, and playing D&D and video games like Diablo. When my schedule allows, I go to the gym 5/7 days a week and walk trails around the city, sometimes with my GirlTrek ladies.

As a lifelong learner, I am learning to speak German and strategize in chess, hoping to slow my cognitive decline. I also took Paralegal Technology classes at Hinds to better understand how the U.S. and State governments function.

I like to try new restaurants and write reviews of the places I've enjoyed on Google Maps. Having lived in several states, GA -> FL -> TX, I have made many friends from across the country. Although I've enjoyed living in other locations and visiting foreign countries, I'm happy to return to Mississippi because there's no place like home.

## Education and Expertise üéì
I received my BSc in Computer Science from The University of Mississippi in December 2010. After college, I interned at the Jackson Free Press before moving to Georgia for an entry-level Java Developer position with Verizon. I followed that experience with close to five years with Deloitte in Florida before relocating to Texas to contract with several financial services companies.

When I moved back to Mississippi in 2023, I started a non-profit technology company, JXNMS Engineering Laboratory, to address the lack of "pragmatic programming" skills that were debilitating the growth of software development in the private sector. I continue to channel much of my accumulated knowledge into building programming for my nescient organization and assisting small businesses in better utilizing their technology integrations.

## MDEQ - OIT - Applications Developer IV üñ•Ô∏è
In my new position at MDEQ as an Applications Developer IV in the IT department, I will serve the public by applying my 10+ years of experience developing enterprise-level applications to the purpose of improving the efficiency of the software that our state agency relies on "to safeguard the health, safety, and welfare of present and future generations of Mississippians by conserving and improving our environment and fostering wise economic growth through focused research and responsible regulation."

My current projects include maintaining and modernizing OLWR's MSWIS and Dam Safety applications, the Human Resources Management System, Geology's Flood Map Modernization and MDEM sites, and the Mining application.
